Task 1
# File Reader with Error Handling in Python

This Python program attempts to read the contents of a text file and handles the case where the file does not exist.

## Features

- Tries to open and read a file named `my_file1.txt`
- Reads and prints each line from the file
- Includes exception handling using `try-except` to catch `FileNotFoundError`
- Displays a user-friendly error message if the file is missing

## Usage

Place a file named `my_file1.txt` in the same directory as the script or update the `filename` variable with the correct path.

Task 2

# File Write, Append, and Read in Python

This Python program demonstrates basic file handling operations: writing to a file, appending additional text, and reading the final contents of the file.

## Features

- Writes user-provided text to a file (`output.txt`)
- Appends additional user input to the same file
- Reads and displays the full contents of the file after writing and appending

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. You will be prompted to enter text twiceâ€”first to write and then to append. The script will show the final content of the file.
